# Celeste++
A library to parse files from the game Celeste. Currently just a port of a few functions from Maple for the map portion, but includes a full parser for the game's dialog.

Examples:
* mapbin: A simple example of printing information and changing a map bin's package.
* switchify: A C++ port of the Switchify script from Fuji. Changes each map's package to it's filename.
* dialog: Parses, prints, and formats the dialog from nameguy's Reflection D-Side
* dialogpatcher: Patches the dialog from nameguy's Reflection D-Side
