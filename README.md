# Celeste++
A library to parse files from the game Celeste. Currently just a port of a few functions from Maple.

Examples:
* mapbin: A simple example of printing information and changing a map bin's package.
* switchify: A C++ port of the Switchify script from Fuji. Changes each map's script to it's filename.
